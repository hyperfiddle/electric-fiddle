This is the second part of a 3 part series about building tools with Electric Clojure. Earlier this week in [Internal Tools and Electric Clojure, Part 1](/blog/y20250106_threaddump_part1) I described how in **31 lines of code and 20 minutes** I built a thread dumper utility. At the end I wondered aloud, **how long it would take to get a proper clojure.datify data browser view,** so we could get better thread observability in a more structured way than mashing strings together?

So, it's now three days later, let's take a look at the progress! Here it is:

<div style="margin-bottom: 2em;"></div>

!target-nochrome[docs-site.blog.threaddump2/ThreadDump2]()

<div style="margin-bottom: 2em;"></div>

What's happening

* General EDN viewer utility
* select a target object - I gave you a jvm thread interface, a git repo, and two classes
* top panel displays target object as a nested document
* hover the unqualified attribute names to see their namespace in tooltip (edit: disabled for now, due to a css layout interaction with virtual scroll container)
* it contains hyperlinks marked `...`, e.g. the git log, click them!
* hyperlinks open in the bottom panel - a table view with dynamic column picker

We're definitely not finished with our goal of "structured thread browser UI", but it's still an interesting checkpoint in the journey.

As before, we want to understand: 
* how many lines of code do you think?
* how many hours to build do you think?

## Code

Here is the entrypoint with target picker, **29 LOC** (one third of which is the namespace definition):

!ns-src[docs-site.blog.threaddump2]()

Here's the datafy-jvm implementation, **27 LOC** at time of writing:

!ns-src[dustingetz.datafy-jvm]()

Here's the [two pane EdnViewer code](https://gist.github.com/dustingetz/5f089be0e3dc66c13b2e57b4349f47ed), as a gist because at **99 LOC** is a bit too long to embed here. For completeness, this gist has two notable dependencies: 
1. `dustingetz.easy-table/TableScroll` from Part 1, and 
2. `dustingetz.flatten-document/flatten-nested`, a throwaway Claude fn (attached also in the gist).

That's everything, there are **no other namespaces with secret code that I am hiding,** this is literally it.

## Conclusion

This blog series has a time axis. Part 1 was published on Tuesday the 7th, and today I publish part 2 on Friday the 10th, three days later. I spent about 12 hours on it (including the writing!), in between all the other stuff I had to do this week like write memos for attorneys and work on customer deals. And Electric Clojure has brought it within my reach of my leftover fragments of time to run little experiments like this, cheaply enough to fit in the cracks of my week.

What would it be like, if your business could afford to run product experiments, to try ideas, to change features, and have the **cost of these experiments be so low that you can just try things, in the moment you think of them?** What if you could build systems and not be limited by the debugging and the planning and the refactoring and the tech debt, but instead **actualize your ideas, as fast as you can think them?** 

For example, idea: let's make the demo also do git operations, because that's a more interesting demo than Java threads, that everyone understands, and I happen to have lying around! And now, 10 minutes later, this *web page* is doing *git operations!* Because *why not*? I was able to *think it* easily enough. Why should we accept technology that can't keep up with our thoughts?

Let me restate that: **With Electric, the bottleneck is no longer the coding of the implementation, it is the product design. It is *you*.** Let that sink in.

Are you getting it?

Check out [the Electric tutorial here](https://electric.hyperfiddle.net/tutorial/), and [sign up for beta access here](https://www.hyperfiddle.net/early-access.html), we are expanding the beta rapidly.

Part 3 will be about implementing the actual thread browser, with navigation. See you next week!
