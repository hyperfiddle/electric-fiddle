# Forms with inline submit <span id="title-extra"><span>

<div id="nav"></div>

Sometimes, you want to submit each field individually (NOT as a form). e.g. iOS preferences, or settings page in a b2b saas.

What's happening
* inline submit - each field saves and subnmits independently
* keyboard support - try it! `enter` to submit, `esc` to discard
* auto-submit means: don't even need the buttons, it just auto-saves (SaaS style)
