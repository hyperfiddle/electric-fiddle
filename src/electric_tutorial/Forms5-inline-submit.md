# Forms5-inline-submit

* `Input!` with field level stage - just an explainer - sets up the inline Submit! controls

!fiddle-ns[](electric-tutorial.forms5-inline-submit/Forms5-inline-submit)

What's happening
* each field has it's own inline submit
* busy
* failure!
* retry!

Why / what for
* Matches the true semantics of <a href="">TodoMVC</a> and a spreadsheet (tab - commit; esc - discard), but these controls have a poor UX. Onward!

How it works
