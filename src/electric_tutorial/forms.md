Uncontrolled inputs.

!fiddle-ns[](electric-tutorial.forms/Forms)

What's happening
* form with two fields
* input controls are "uncontrolled" (controlled input next)
* pending state
* monitoring

Novel forms
* e/amb

Key ideas
* controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
* "Submit" inputs
* edits flow to the application root, which transacts all in one place
* token callback used to control extent
