# Electric Fiddle

The easiest way to get started with Electric Clojure.

This is how we fiddle around with stuff at work. All our demos are here.<br>
This is how we recommend you start, because itâ€™s all self contained.

One day your app will have grown and youâ€™ll be ready to eject it. <br>
Youâ€™ll delete what you donâ€™t need (thereâ€™s not much anyway) and youâ€™ll be good to go.

You can fork this repo or clone it and have your own branch.
Weâ€™ll continue to update the main branch.<br>
Youâ€™ll be able to track changes and merge them as needed.

## Quick Start

```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ yarn
```

Begin with an example "Hello World" fiddle:

```shell
$ clj -A:dev
```
At the REPL:
```clojure
(dev/-main)
;; => INFO  dev: {:host "0.0.0.0", :port 8080, :resources-path "public", :manifest-path "public/js/manifest.edn"}
;; => INFO  dev: Starting Electric compiler and server...
;; => shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9001
;; => [:dev] Configuring build.
;; => [:dev] Compiling ...
;; => [:dev] Build completed. (231 files, 2 compiled, 0 warnings, 2.46s)
;; => INFO  electric-fiddle.server: ðŸ‘‰ http://0.0.0.0:8080
;; => Loading fiddle: hello-fiddle
;; => Loaded: hello-fiddle.fiddles
```

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
2. Corresponding source code is in `src-fiddles/hello_world`

## Load more fiddles

Letâ€™s load the Electric Tutorial fiddle. It requires some extra dependencies.
```shell
$ clj -A:dev:electric-tutorial
```
At the REPL:
```clojure
(dev/-main)
;; => ...
;; => INFO  electric-fiddle.server: ðŸ‘‰ http://0.0.0.0:8080

(dev/load-fiddle! 'electric-tutorial)
;; => Loading fiddle: electric-tutorial
;; => Loaded: electric-tutorial.fiddle
```
In your browser, a new entry entry for `electric-fiddle` popped up.

Optional:
```clojure
(dev/unload-fiddle! 'hello-world)
```

## Roll your own

1. `mkdir src-fiddles/my_fiddle`
3. Add the following to `src-fiddles/my_fiddle/fiddles.cljc`:
```clojure
(ns my-fiddle.fiddles
  (:require [hyperfiddle.electric :as e]
            [hyperfiddle.electric-dom2 :as dom]))

(e/defn MyFiddle []
  (e/client
    (dom/h1 (dom/text "Hello from my fiddle."))))

(e/def fiddles ; Entries for the dev index
  {`MyFiddle MyFiddle})

(e/defn FiddleMain [ring-req] ; prod entrypoint
  (e/server
    (binding [e/http-request ring-req])
      (e/client
        (binding [dom/node js/document.body]
          (MyFiddle.)))))
```

At the REPL:
```clojure
(dev/load-fiddle! 'my-fiddle)
```

If your fiddle requires extra dependencies:

- add them as an alias in `deps.edn`:

```clojure
{:aliases {:my-fiddle {:extra-deps {my.extra/dependency {:mvn/version "123"}}}}}
```

- Restart your REPL with the new alias: `$ clj -A:dev:my-fiddle`

# Prod build

Deploys one fiddle at a time.

## "Hello World" prod build

```shell
$ clojure -X:build:prod build-client :hyperfiddle/domain hello-fiddle # :debug false :verbose false :optimize true
$ clj -M:prod -m prod
```

## With extra dependencies
```shell
$ clojure -X:build:prod:electric-tutorial build-client :hyperfiddle/domain electric-tutorial
$ clj -M:prod:electric-tutorial -m prod
# http://localhost:8080/electric-tutorial.tutorial!%54utorial/electric-tutorial.demo-two-clocks!%54wo%43locks
```

# Uberjar

```shell
$ clojure -X:build:prod uberjar :hyperfiddle/domain hello-fiddle :build/jar-name "app.jar"
```

# Fly.io deployment

```shell
$ fly deploy --remote-only --config src-fiddles/hello_fiddle/fly.toml
```
